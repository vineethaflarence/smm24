                  >That cortical activity tracks the dynamics of auditory
                  stimuli is reasonably well established. In speech and music
                  perception, this phenomenon produces reliable coupling between
                  the acoustic envelope of the sound input and the corresponding
                  cortical responses. However, it remains unclear to what extent
                  that neural tracking reflects low-level acoustic properties,
                  as opposed to more abstract linguistic structures. In this
                  talk, I will discuss a series of studies aimed at assessing
                  the impact of higher-order linguistic information on the
                  cortical processing of speech and music sounds. I will
                  demonstrate methodologies for disentangling neural responses
                  to stimulus properties at different abstraction levels,
                  deriving multiple objective indices for probing auditory
                  perception with experiments involving natural speech and music
                  listening. I will then describe recent developments of these
                  measures in the context of developmental research.</span

                  >Giovanni received his Bachelor's degree in Information
                  Engineering in 2011 and his Master's degree in Computer
                  Engineering in 2013, both from the University of Padova,
                  Italy. After a period working on his thesis at University
                  College Cork (UCC, Ireland), he joined Edmund Lalor's research
                  lab in Trinity College Dublin where he pursued a PhD in
                  auditory neuroscience in the School of Electronic and
                  Electrical Engineering. He received his PhD in 2017 and he
                  joined the Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs at École
                  Normale Superieure (Paris) immediately after, under the
                  supervision of Alain de Cheveigné and Shihab Shamma. Then, he
                  briefly continued his work on speech communication with
                  Richard Reilly as a postdoctoral researcher (TCD), while also
                  working with Simon Kelly at UCD, expanding his expertise into
                  the Decision Making domain. He holds the title of Assistant
                  Professor in Intelligent Systems in the School of Computer
                  Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin. Giovanni's
                  scientific interests centre on understanding the brain
                  mechanisms underlying speech comprehension. In his work, he
                  develops data analysis methods and applies them to brain data
                  to identify the neural processes responsible for the
                  transformation of a sensory stimulus into its abstract
                  meaning. Brain electrical data is measured with either
                  non-invasive (e.g., electroencephalography - EEG) or invasive
                  (e.g., electrocorticography - ECoG) technologies. The first
                  aspect of his research is methodological and has produced
                  novel experimental and analysis frameworks to investigate
                  cortical auditory processing. The second aspect of his
                  research is to use such novel methods to test theories on
                  auditory perception, such as the hierarchical processing of
                  speech and predictive processing theories (e.g. predictive
                  coding). Finally, the third part of his work is translational
                  and involves the identification of solutions to utilise his
                  novel methods in applied settings, for example as tools to
                  develop brain-computer interfaces or as objective measures for
                  the monitoring of language development and healthy
                  ageing.</span

                >With recent advances in machine learning, automated dialogue
                systems have become more able to produce coherent language-based
                interactions. However, most work on automated spoken language
                understanding uses still only text transcriptions, i.e., just
                the lexical content of speech. This ignores the fact that the
                way we speak can change how our words are interpreted. In
                particular, speech prosody --e.g. pitch, energy, and timing
                characteristics of speech -- can be used to signal speaker
                intent in spoken dialogues. In fact, prosodic features can help
                automatic detection of both dialogue structure and speaker
                affect/states. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on
                how we can combine non-lexical and lexical aspects to speech to
                improve speech understanding tasks, such as emotion recognition,
                and how new approaches to self-supervised learning from speech
                might be able to help us make the most of the true richness of
                speech.</span

                Technology, working at the Centre for Speech Technology Research
                at the University of Edinburgh. She specialises in spoken
                language understanding, affective computing, and multimodal
                speech processing. Her main focus on interest is how non-lexical
                aspects of speech contribute to discourse and dialogue
                understanding. She's particularly interested in speech prosody,
                e.g., pitch, energy, and timing, and how varying the way we
                speak can change our understanding of speaker intent in a
                dialogue from both a recognition and generation perspective. She
                has also worked on evaluating speech and language technologies
